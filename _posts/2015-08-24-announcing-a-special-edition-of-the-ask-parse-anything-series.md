In the past few months, our team has truly enjoyed hearing from you and answering your questions with our Ask Parse Anything video series.

With the open sourcing of our SDKs, we are excited to host a special edition event with **Ask Parse Anything: Inside Our SDKs**!  Our SDK team will be taking your questions this time around, sharing best practices, learnings, and more.

**<a href="https://airtable.com/shrkp5GJ0IxkgHqPj" target="_blank">Submit your questions here</a> from now until 11:59 PM PDT on Friday, September 4th, **and we'll be answering them on Thursday, September 10th.  In the meantime, check out our very own Grantland Chew's deep dive on the more challenging aspects of building the Parse SDKs <a href="http://blog.parseplatform.org/learn/the-parse-sdk-whats-inside/" target="_blank">here</a>!

Got a general question about our products or pricing? We'll be hosting a regular Ask Parse Anything at the end of September--stay tuned for more details soon!
