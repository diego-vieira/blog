In the last year, the Parse team has been incredibly excited to see our developer community grow at a tremendous rate. Not only has our community itself grown, but Parse developers have built some of the most celebrated and successful apps of 2014.

We're happy to share the accomplishments of these apps—many of them earning spots on awards lists, top charts, and more. In fact, 10% of Google's top Android Apps of 2014 and 10% of Apple's top iOS Apps of 2014 use Parse.
