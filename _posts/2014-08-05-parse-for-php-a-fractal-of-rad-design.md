Today we are very happy to release the <a title="Parse PHP SDK" href="https://parse.com/products/php" target="_blank">Parse PHP SDK</a>, which will enable Parse integration for a whole new class of apps and different use cases. This is our first SDK for a server-side language, and the first to be truly open-source.

PHP is an incredibly popular programming language and has consistently been in the top 10 on the <a href="http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/PHP.html" target="_blank">TIOBE index</a> for the past 15 years. Some metrics report that it is still serving the vast majority of websites on the internet. Until now, if you wanted to access Parse from PHP, the REST API was the only option. A few Parse <a href="https://github.com/apotropaic/parse.com-php-library" target="_blank">API</a> <a href="https://github.com/spacious/sparse/tree/master/Sparse" target="_blank">wrapper</a> <a href="https://github.com/KochAbo/php-parse-api" target="_blank">libraries</a> have been released by third parties on GitHub. While we think this is awesome, many developers requested better PHP support and we decided to build a first-party SDK.

Earlier this year at Facebook's f8 developer conference, we launched the completely re-invented <a href="https://github.com/facebook/facebook-php-sdk-v4" target="_blank">Facebook SDK for PHP</a>. In the 3 months since it was released there have been over 160 commits, with good solid contributions and enhancements from 20 passionate developers who use and care about the product. It has been a lot of fun managing the process for the Facebook SDK, and I'm looking forward to working together with the community on this Parse SDK.

For a fast overview of the SDK, check out the <a href="https://github.com/parseplatform/parse-php-sdk/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">README file</a>. We've also updated our documentation with a new <a href="https://parse.com/docs/php_guide" target="_blank">PHP guide</a>, and added a <a href="https://parse.com/apps/quickstart#parse_data/php" target="_blank">PHP Quickstart</a> with installation instructions. We encourage you to report any issues and requests on <a href="https://github.com/parseplatform/parse-php-sdk" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

Go build something awesome with Parse + PHP!
