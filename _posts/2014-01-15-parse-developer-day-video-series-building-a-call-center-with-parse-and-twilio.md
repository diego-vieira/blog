_The introduction of this blog post is a guest post from Twilio Developer Evangelist Kevin Whinnery._

API platforms like Parse and <a href="https://www.twilio.com/" target="_blank">Twilio</a> are changing the way developers build applications. By providing high-level building blocks for tasks like data persistence, user management, messaging, and VoIP communication, developers can rapidly assemble new software solutions when an opportunity arises. With these capabilities in hand, developers can focus on building unique value for their users in surprising ways. They can use software to solve problems that were previously out of their reach.

One problem space that is now open to software people is the call center, a key business component that at one time was a black box of arcane telecom technologies. In this video, we'll see how you can use Twilio and Parse to quickly build a custom call center application entirely in the cloud. Using the <a href="https://www.parse.com/docs/cloud_modules_guide#twilio" target="_blank">Twilio Cloud Code module</a> and Parse platform, you can create VoIP apps in the browser for support agents, accept and route inbound calls, and send text messages all with a few lines of JavaScript code.

This is just one example of the new breed of applications that are now easily created by software people. We can't wait to see what yours looks like.
