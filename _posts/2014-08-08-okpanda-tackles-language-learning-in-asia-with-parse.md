Learning a new language is often a task full of tangled tongues and frustrating phrases. With the arrival of <a href="http://www.okpanda.com/" target="_blank">OKpanda</a>, however, these roadblocks to learning English may be alleviated. Launched on iOS in December of 2013, OKpanda has taken a mobile-first approach towards creating a novel curricula combined with smart gaming to pioneer innovative ways to help users learn English.

It's not the first time this team has taken on mobile development, or gaming. Cofounded by Nir Markus, the former CTO of PlayerDuel, a mobile platform that turned any mobile game into a social game with friends, Markus and his PlayerDuel team saw installations in over 30 million mobile devices in its first year. With this experience shaping the strategy behind OKpanda, the team has initially tackled the Japanese segment of the Asian English-learning market. Japan is one of the largest language learning markets in Asia, with approximately $5 billion currently spent on language services.

For many new English speakers, OKpanda's research found that the number one requested skill by students is conversation practice. The app then simulates real life situations, and allows the user to practice their conversation skills. Users can participate in an exchange by listening and selecting the right answer, and vocal conversation is now in the works. With this emphasis on conversation practice, OKpanda saw over 260,000 downloads in Japan within the first 50 days of its launch without any marketing spend.

As OKpanda continues to grow rapidly in Japan, and across Asia, it has become more important than ever to be able to directly reach its users. Given the repetitive and consistent nature of language practice, engagement through Parse Push has allowed OKpanda to continually captivate the concentration of their users. Currently, OKpanda releases a new conversational situation 2 times a week, and users are notified of each release through Parse Push. The choice to use Parse Push is one that has been positively reinforced through OKpanda's ability to immediately preview how the push notification will look on mobile. Additionally, according to its cofounder Nir Markus, the team has found that the use of Parse Push has accelerated the company's efficiency on a variety of levels:

> When starting a new startup, it's very important to move fast, especially before you've reached a product-market fit. To move fast, there is no need to invent the wheel, and the possibility of using services like Parse to power your product is a huge time saver.

OKpanda delivers a unique language-learning experience that can be found now on the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jp/app/okpanda-ying-hui-hua/id670441812?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a>. Mobile language learning finally has a taste of the best of both worlds--it's now both fun and easy.
