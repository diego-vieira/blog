A long time ago, developers had to painstakingly create multiple versions of their Parse apps in order to manage development and production environments; but no more! After long hours of research, we've cracked the app genome and we're happy to announce the brand new ability to clone apps.

From the newly redesigned Parse dashboard, you'll now be able to quickly clone an app that you've made or that has been shared with you by a colleague. This will clone the schema, cloud code, security and white-labeling settings, and config parameters; everything about the app except the data and the background jobs schedules. (We know cloning data is a highly requested capability, and we're exploring ways to do it in a limited fashion.)

If you want to customize what goes into your new app, you can head over to the settings page and select exactly what you need in your clone â€” a clone to order, if you will!

We're excited to see how you'll use this new feature and how we can improve similar workflows in the future. After all, large apps require a lot of effort from many developers, and we want to make this as easy and simple as possible with Parse.
