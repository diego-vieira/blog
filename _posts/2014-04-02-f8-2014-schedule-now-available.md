The schedule for f8 is <a href="https://fbf8.com/schedule.html" target="_blank">now available</a>! Mark Zuckerberg will kick it off with a keynote in the morning and then we'll have more than 20 technical sessions in the afternoon.

We'll also be live streaming all the keynotes and tracks from f8. If you can't join us in person, be sure and tune in to the live stream of all the keynotes and tracks to catch all the new stuff and great content. Register <a href="https://fbf8.com" target="_blank">here</a> to learn more and be notified when the live stream begins.

Everyone at Parse is really excited to be part of f8 this year and we hope to see you there!
