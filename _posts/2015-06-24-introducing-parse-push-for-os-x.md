Push notifications are powerful. In fact, for many people, they have become essential. Every day their favorite mobile apps deliver important information to their device's home screen: the latest breaking news, location-specific suggestions, important messages from friends and family. Increasingly, we're seeing desktop apps take advantage of push notifications as well.

That's why we're excited to announce today that we're **bringing Parse Push to OS X**. With the <a href="https://parse.com/docs/downloads" target="_blank">Parse SDK</a> for OS X, you can add push notifications to your application in a matter of minutes. You can also take advantage of Parse Push features like A/B testing, scheduling, and audience segmentation.

Under the hood, Parse Push for OS X uses our existing push infrastructure. Built for massive scale, Parse Push broadcasts to millions of devices across the world each day. We also support push on iOS, Android, Unity and Windows platforms, allowing you to leverage a single push service for all your app's platforms.

To get started, download our latest <a href="https://parse.com/downloads/ios/parse-osx-library/latest" target="_blank">OS X SDK</a> and follow our Quick Start guides for <a href="https://parse.com/apps/quickstart#parse_push/osx/native" target="_blank">Objective-C</a> or <a href="https://parse.com/apps/quickstart#parse_push/osx/swift" target="_blank">Swift</a>. ForÂ advanced topics, like A/B testing with Push Experiments or tracking push notification engagement, don't forget to check out the new <a href="https://parse.com/docs/osx/guide#push-notifications" target="_blank">Push Notifications</a> guide.

We can't wait to see how you use Parse Push in your OS X apps!
