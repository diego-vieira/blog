Next weekend, more than 17,000 people will be getting together at over 450 locations worldwide, to collaborate and build games (digital or not). Facebook is hosting one of those locations at our headquarters in Menlo Park, and members of the Parse team will be on hand to offer support!

Bear Douglas and I will be leading a session Friday evening about developing Unity games on Parse. The session will cover setup, some basic integration ideas, and include a sample Unity project with code examples. In the true spirit of hack, the app doesn't exist yet, but we're working on it!
