The company has turned to Parse to help them release several apps, most notably <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/hobbit-official-visual-companion/id763459727?mt=8" target="_blank">The Hobbit: Official Visual Companion</a>, a guide to Middle-earth with a beautifully rendered 3D map and variety of encyclopedic articles, as well as the release of Brian Cox’s <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/brian-coxs-wonders-universe/id508465867?mt=8" target="_blank">Wonders of the Universe</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brian-coxs-wonders-of-life/id773114288?mt=8" target="_blank">Wonders of Life</a>.

HarperCollins has a long history of producing engaging apps for consumers, but Parse has helped enable more direct engagement with consumers. Now, HarperCollins is able to better understand how content is being consumed, and in turn reward consumers with more relevant material. Parse Core is used for storing user data and tracking app opens, in addition to enabling the team to find out more about their users in order to market relevant content to them across the apps. Concurrently, Parse Push has allowed the sending of more sophisticated and segmented push notifications.

According to Sam,

> Having a solution like this allows us to concentrate more on creating a great user experience while also helping us add scale and reduce cost—all massive positives for our mobile strategy. It’s also giving us the core building blocks of building out a single consumer view—allowing us to give readers more of what they want more of the time, and making sure our communications are tailored to reflect that. We are actively looking to expand our use of Parse across all platforms to help us achieve that objective.
