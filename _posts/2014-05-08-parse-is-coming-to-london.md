Over the past year, 140,000 new developers started building mobile apps on Parse and 50% of those developers were from Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. With thousands of developers using Parse throughout the UK, we’re building a team in London to better support the area’s thriving developer community and engineering talent.

The Parse London team will be based out of the Facebook London office, which is moving to a beautiful new location in central London in early June. We're hiring engineers to help build the next big Parse products and to support products we’re building in collaboration with the Facebook Platform team.

We’re also looking for partner managers and partner engineers who will work directly with the biggest app developers in Europe, helping them to build awesome cross-platform apps using Parse. The team is already working with companies like Deezer, TopShop and Mind Candy.

We prioritize our product road map based on the feedback we get from our customers, and having a team on the ground in London allows us to cater the future of Parse products to the needs of our global community.

If you’re in London tonight, join us for a Parse meetup and cocktail party at Facebook to celebrate and meet some of our team. Sign up for the group <a href="http://www.meetup.com/London-Parse-Developer-Meetup/" target="_blank">here</a>; we'd love to meet you!
