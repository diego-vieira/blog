In choosing a support system with whom to co-develop LINE whoscall, Gogolook chose Parse in addition to LINE, an incredibly popular messaging app on smartphones and PCs with over 450 million users in over 230 countries worldwide.

After a friend from their local startup community recommended Parse, Gogolook, acquired by Naver near the end of 2013, decided to use Parse Push in LINE whoscall. As Peter Su Chen-Hao, Product Director of Gogolook reports, the team appreciated that with Parse Push, they didn’t need to create a notification database, allowing them to focus on product development and function improvement instead.

He continues by explaining,

> Parse provides developers and companies with a very stable and convenient backend service. For example, you can use Parse as a login database instead of establishing one on your own. Tools like these make Parse a must-have tool for app developers!

LINE whoscall has been working to protect users from harassment of unexpected phone calls with its powerful database and user sharing community. Now, the team is working to expand service coverage to users all over the world. LINE whoscall can be <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gogolook.callgogolook2" target="_blank">downloaded on Google Play</a>.
