By using Parse for Push in their previous apps, the <a title="Fox International Channels" href="http://foxinternationalchannels.com/" target="_blank">Fox International Channels</a> (FIC) team was able to shift from selling apps for clients to instead concentrating on building apps for their own FIC brands.  This continued momentum is clear with the accomplishments achieved by Destino Brasil.  In its first 4 weeks, the app saw over 150,000 installs, and over 500,000 votes were cast through the Voto FOX system, exemplifying an enthusiastic level of engagement by Destino Brasil's user base.

Given their prior experience working with Parse, the development team was happy with the results of earlier releases, and the transition to using Parse for Destino Brasil was seamless.

According to Leonardo Rosales, Web Production Executive Director for Fox Latin America Channels, Parse has been the best ongoing solution,

> It would have taken a lot of time and resources for us to implement our own solution.  Our developers would have to start from scratch...it would be a pain to put everything together.  Parse is already up and running for a budget price.

As Fox International Channels continues to grow, their objective is to have under ten apps running over the major platforms--browsers, iOS, Android, Windows Phone--and targeting marketing efforts on these focused apps.  Latin America has been a formative testing ground as one of the most developed regions in the sports world, and a region that only continues to progress with the vitality powered by events such as this year's World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics.

For Leonardo's team, Parse also continues to be the ideal partner through these developments, and their favorite feature, Parse's reliability, is one that will carry them through it all.
