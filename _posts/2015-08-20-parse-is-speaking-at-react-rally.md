Catch our very own Andrew Imm, resident React expert, on Day 1 of React Rally. His talk will cover when and how to use the new Observe API,Â and discuss how it stands to change the way we build and organize React components. Andrew will also detail how Parse implemented the first data source designed to interact with this API, and the lessons learned along the way. Finally, he'll explore some unique use cases for observable data to inspire your own projects.
