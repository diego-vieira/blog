As a long-standing player in China's gaming and internet industries, Elex was founded in 2008 with a focus on developing mobile games. With partners including Baidu, Tencent, Alibaba, 7Road, and Giant Interactive, Elex has grown rapidly, rising to the forefront of game development in both Asian and Western markets.

The latest to Elex's gaming family, Age of Warring Empire, has soared to the top of the charts, with over 20 million downloads to date. It has also charted as one of the top 30 grossing apps on Android for several consecutive months. Age of Warring Empire is supported by Parse Push, and the game is popular on both the Android and iOS platforms.

While strategy and war games are popular no matter the hemisphere, Elex decided to add yet another element of complexity to Age of Warring Empire. Beyond the basics of a strategy game, the team explored RPG elements and a top-notch player vs. player system to craft a unique experience found only in Age of Warring Empire.

These layers of complexity have attracted a strong user base, and in order to communicate directly with players, Age of Warring Empire uses <a href="https://parse.com/products/push" target="_blank">Parse Push</a>.
