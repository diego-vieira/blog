From web browsers to node servers to Parse Cloud Code, JavaScript is everywhere. If you write application logic or library code in JavaScript, it can run on your website, in your mobile app, and even on your backend servers. But for whatever reason, JavaScript isn't everyone's favorite language. And even if it was, it's unlikely that any one programming language would be the optimal tool for every situation.

So, in order to bring the same diversity of programming language options to the web that we have on the desktop, many people have developed compilers that can take code written in other languages and translate it to JavaScript. This is called "transpiling". With transpiled languages, such as CoffeeScript and TypeScript, you can take advantage of language features that aren't available in stock JavaScript, while still being able to write code that runs everywhere.

In this talk from HTML5DevConf, I give an overview of several transpiled languages, and point out some of the great benefits that you can get from using them. Whether or not you decide a transpiled language is right for your project, I hope this talk will give you some food for thought about what the future of the JavaScript platform could be.
