_This is a guest post from Nick Quinlan, Developer Evangelist at <a href="http://sendgrid.com/" target="_blank">SendGrid</a>._

Once you’ve built your app, you’re faced with the challenge of getting users to use it. This is even more difficult when you consider that <a href="http://www.localytics.com/blog/2011/26percent-of-mobile-app-users-are-either-fickle-or-loyal/" target="_blank">26% of users never re-open an app</a>.

This talk discusses using email as a way to ensure repeat usage of your app. It looks at different kinds of user engagement emails, examines their strengths and weaknesses, and demonstrates how to send them using Parse Cloud Code.

By adopting the techniques described in this talk and using other engagement techniques, like Push Notifications, and SMS you’ll help ensure users stick with your app after downloading.
