[<img class="alignnone wp-image-2450" style="border: 0pt none; float: right; padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/red-bull-221x300.png" alt="Red Bull Wallpapers" width="321" height="434" />]({{ site.url }}/assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/red-bull.png)While some reach for Red Bull on the shelves of beverage aisles, the global brand itself has reached far beyond the boundaries of any storefront. Since 2007, the <a href="http://www.redbullmediahouse.com/" target="_blank">Red Bull Media House</a> has been constantly seeking innovative ways to expand the boundaries of the user experience that is the Red Bull brand. From its inception, Red Bull Media House sought to establish itself as a multi-platform media company with a focus on sports, culture, and lifestyle. Given the wide range of media products housed across its umbrella brand, Red Bull Media House began to double down on app development in 2009 in search of ways to tie them all together. Today, Red Bull Media House has put 30 apps to market across all platforms.

Its latest hit, Red Bull Wallpapers, is a demonstration of Red Bull's incredibly unique offerings, and of its ability to bring them together in innovative ways with Red Bull Media House. With the use of <a href="https://parse.com/products/core" target="_blank">Parse Core</a>, Red Bull Wallpapers brings captivating imagery from the World of Red Bull straight to the palm of a user's hand. Android users can customize their home and lock screens with static wallpapers or with animated and enhanced live wallpapers of their favorite Red Bull athletes. Other choices include photos from sports including motocross, motorsports such as Formula One, skateboarding, surfing, skiing, BMX, and more.

In order to deliver such high-quality sports photography to its mobile users, Red Bull Media House utilizes Parse Core to store and load all wallpaper-related data. This includes the name of the athlete or the photographer credits. The data browser is also used for analytics, insights, and updating the use count.  With the use of Parse, development time is saved on the server side, enabling developers to focus even more strongly on the core aspects such as quality and content of the app.

Alongside the release of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redbull.wallpapers&hl=en" target="_blank">Red Bull Wallpapers</a>, the brand has become more prominent than ever by tackling all perspectives of a customer's daily life. From the home screen to the big screen and beyond, experiences such as the one offered by Red Bull Wallpapers provide an inspiring extension of the Red Bull brand.
