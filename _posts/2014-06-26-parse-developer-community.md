In 2011, when we launched Parse, we caught the attention of a lot of great mobile developers, eager for a solution like ours. We were quickly faced with questions and feedback that needed to be fielded. We decided to do what many young startups do and built our own tool, a custom Community Forum that was similar to Stack Overflow but tightly integrated with Parse. This has been a labor of love for us, and for a long time, it was precisely the tool that worked well for us.

After 2 years and over 20,000 questions, we've decided to try something more scalable and familiar to developers around the world. We will be moving over to several industry standard tools like [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/parse.com) and [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/parse-developers) to help accommodate the growing community of Parse developers. Whenever we've found ourselves in need of help, we've gravitated towards using these same tools. We're excited to continue fostering a vibrant Parse developer community and we hope you'll take advantage of it when you need help building something awesome. For those of you that have contributed so much time and energy to our community forums in the past, we'd like to enthusiastically say: Thank you!

Plusâ€”don't forget about [the new way to report bugs](http://blog.parseplatform.org/2014/03/25/a-new-way-to-report-bugs/) that we launched earlier this year. This has helped us move from just a couple of folks handling bug reports to a global team of bug squashers, based in London, Dublin, and the US.

We hope you'll find these new tools helpful, and we invite you to try all of them out on our [new Help page](https://parse.com/help).
