For businesses across the globe, file sharing has become a ubiquitous, of-the-minute tool that is constantly utilized in all kinds of work settings. Sensing an opportunity and reimagining the way files are shared, Japan's [NEOS Corporation](http://www.neoscorp.jp/) has tackled file sharing with a fresh new take with the release of Meety. In Japan, email communication has been replaced with chat. Simultaneously, file sharing tools such as Dropbox and Evernote have drastically grown in usage. Thus, Meety sought to find a common ground between the two, developing a comprehensive chat application with file sharing features.

By using Meety's integration with Dropbox, Google Drive, and Box, users can easily transfer files to each otherâ€”from music to movie files to PowerPoints, Word Docs, Excel spreadsheets, PDFs, and more. Files are stored and managed in every chat room, allowing for simple search functionality if a user needs to return to the file in the future.

For execution of the app, the Meety team at NEOS Corporation turned to Parse. NEOS Corporation has a wide array of resources, including investor backing from NTT Docomo, Sharp Corporation, and KDDI Corporation. Upon coming across Parse on an external blog, the team decided to give it a try. According to Meety's software development manager:

> By using Parse, we were able to launch the service without incurring large infrastructure costs. We saved about three crucial months in developing our app, which also brought down our development costs.

Meety is now available for download on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id867944221), and is coming soon to the Google Play Store.
