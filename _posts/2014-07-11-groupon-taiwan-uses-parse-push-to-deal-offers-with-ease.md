Discovering the best of a city, planning a vacation, and searching a specially curated selection of electronics, fashion, and home furnishings is easier than ever with the scale of Groupon.  As a global leader of local commerce, Groupon has emerged as one of the most powerful channels on earth for consumers to find and enjoy unbeatable deals.

Groupon's extensive reach is especially acute through its <a href="http://www.groupon.com.tw/" target="_blank">Groupon Taiwan</a> market.  By redefining how traditional small businesses attract, retain, and interact with customers, Groupon Taiwan has become not only a key destination for consumers, but a key tool for merchants as well.  Mobile purchases have surged, and with it, Groupon Taiwan's crucial need to develop a comprehensive, cross-platform app to build a closer relationship with their customers.

Since the launch of Groupon Taiwan's site, both Parse and <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/v2.0" target="_blank">Facebook Login</a> have served as standout components of their success.  The Groupon Taiwan app saw thousands of downloads per week after its initial release.  Facebook Login has played a key role in saving customers' time during the registration process.  According to Groupon Taiwan's lead UI designer,

> Facebook Login saved our users' time during the registration process, making it that much easier for a new user to make their first purchase.

Simultaneously, Parse Push has helped to retain those users and drive a much deeper, long-term relationship with Groupon Taiwan customers.  Parse Push streamlines the process for Groupon Taiwan to contact its customers, especially given the time-sensitive nature of its highly sought-after deals.  For Groupon Taiwan, the use of Parse has been a reliable way to tackle retention and user communication,

> We use Parse to push hot deals to our customers.  It's quick and cost-saving, and a direct way to reach our app users.

As Groupon continues to scale internationally, Taiwan is a market that has established an efficient and easy-to-implement method of regularly connecting with its devoted customer base through its use of Parse Push.  Groupon Taiwan is available for download in the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tw.groupon&hl=en%20and%20iOS" target="_blank">Google Play Store</a> and in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/tw/app/chi-he-wan-le-zhe-jia-quan/id469873047?mt=8" target="_blank">App Store</a>.
