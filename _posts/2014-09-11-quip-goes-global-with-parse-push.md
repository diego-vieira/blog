In many workplaces, collaborative word processing is a key activity on a day-to-day basis. However, the tools we use to write collaboratively have remained relatively unchanged in the past thirty years. With Quip, this experience has become much more dynamic, and much more accessible. Quip is a mobile, collaborative word processor that works across smartphones, tablets, and the desktop.

Started in 2012 by Kevin Gibbs and Bret Taylor, the former Chief Technology Officer of Facebook and co-creator of Google Maps, Quip tackles a unique opportunity in high global demand. Having seen tremendous growth in mobile devices, Quip took to redefining the product experience for productivity apps for the era of smartphones and tablets. The Quip app works seamlessly across desktop, iOS, and Android.

Quip turned to <a href="https://parse.com/products/push" target="_blank">Parse Push</a> to handle its push notifications on Android. This was a very strategic move, given that Android has such a large, rapidly growing user baseâ€”particularly outside of the U.S. However, much of this growth has been taking place in places like China, where the Play Store and Google Services are not present. Using Parse Push, Quip was able to reach those users without having to reproduce Google's infrastructure, and now are present on virtually all Android devices around the world. China is Quip's third biggest country, and growing quickly. This has also proved useful for users in Russia, and on devices like the Kindle Fire in the U.S. According to Bret Taylor, CEO of Quip:

> Our favorite aspects of using Parse were the great APIs and great documentation. Thanks to using Parse for notifications on Android devices without Google services, we have a much bigger presence in China.
