Today we're incredibly excited to share five new product announcements with you plus an update to our SDKs, live from the [F8 Developer Conference](https://fbf8.com/stream.html) at Fort Mason in San Francisco.

Since F8 2014, our community of developers has grown to include over 400,000 of you from around the world, moving fast and shipping great experiences on Parse every single day. This community is powering more than 500 million active app installations in the last month alone.We're always looking for ways to help you build, scale, and secure the most successful app experiences possible.

## Introducing the latest and greatest updates to the Parse platform:

**Better Security with the New Enhanced Sessions**
  
Giving you more control than ever over your app's security, the new Enhanced Sessions feature allows you to manage session logins for each device that your users log in with.

**Parse for Web, Parse for Mobile, and now Parse for Internet of Things**
  
Starting today, it is easier than ever to use Parse to build apps for devices like garage door openers, smart batteries, thermostats, security cameras, and much more. Using our new SDK for the Arduino Yún and our Embedded C SDK for Linux and Real Time Operating Systems (RTOS), you can now use the power of Parse to more easily connect apps to hardware devices.

**Let's Build Together — with Parse + React**
  
Meet our new Parse + React library, making it incredibly easy and seamless for you to access and store Parse data from React applications. Build complex and dynamic apps like never before.

**Endless Possibilities, No Matter Which Server You Love**
  
With the new Cloud Code Webhooks, you now have the freedom to write code in whatever language or framework you want. As long as you have a server running it, your Cloud Code can integrate with it.

**Chart New Territory with Parse Explorer**
  
Try our brand-new, powerful debugging tool for production issues in your Parse app. Investigate what's happening with a subset of your app's API requests with our powerful yet easy-to-use query language.

**Supporting Facebook SDK v4**
  
Prior to today, integrating the Facebook SDK with our Parse iOS and Android SDKs has been a seamless process. With the new release of Facebook SDK v4, we're excited to continue to offer the same level of support for the new v4 SDK from day one—while continuing to support the v3 SDK.
