Initially focused on hidden object games, Blue Tea Games has now cracked a code in pinpointing the intersection to where a player can find a captivating story plot while solving intricate challenges. In Fable Age, players can build teams of familiar fairytale heroes, such as Robin Hood or Lancelot, and battle enemies using gem-linking mechanics. As players progress in skill and in the development of their quests, they can customize their characters with unique enchantments to acquire epic loots.

Prior to launching, Blue Tea Games realized the need for a simple solution to building a reliable server. With Parse [Cloud Code](https://parse.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-cloud-code), the team was able to achieve their server needs and focus instead on top-notch graphics and gameplay design. For Fable Age, Blue Tea Games has employed Parse Cloud Code for storage of their data and all interactions relating to it. As Blue Tea Games' lead designer and producer for Fable Age puts it:

> Parse provides a reliable and secure platform to deliver what we need, not to mention their data tables make it easy to build complex fields as well as retrieve useful data.

Given the smaller size of Blue Tea Games' mobile team, the costs and manpower saved through the use of Parse enabled them to allocate their resources elsewhere. Instead of worrying about constant maintenance, the Fable Age team is now able to spend their time and resources on development to make the game even better:

> We're fortunate to not only grow our game with a reliable server like Parse, but to also receive great customer service from Parse engineers.

Additionally, a secret fable hero can be unlocked when a player uses Facebook Connect. Blue Tea Games has found that Fable Age benefits when players can battle tough quests with their friends' heroes. With Facebook, players are now able to connect to their friends and assist each other in complex challenges.

Without the stress of server development, the team behind Fable Age has been able to zero in on the game's experience, bringing to life our favorite fairy tale heroes. Fable Age is available on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/fable-age/id695433457?mt=8), and is coming soon to Android.
