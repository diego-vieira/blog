We're keeping busy this month with a number of events. Check out where we'll be in February, and join us if you can!

**<a href="http://www.apps-world.net/northamerica/" target="_blank">Apps World North America</a> – February 5-6, 2014 – San Francisco, CA**
  
Facebook + Parse will be hosting a booth at Apps World North America, and Developer Advocates Christine Abernathy and Bear Douglas will be doing two different talks. This is a great opportunity to learn more about Parse and Facebook from our team, and stop by our booth afterwards with any questions.

**<a href="http://developerweek.com/" target="_blank">DeveloperWeek</a> - February 15-18, 2014 - San Francisco, CA**
  
Parse engineer Bryan Klimt, of the always popular <a href="http://blog.parseplatform.org/2013/01/29/whats-so-great-about-javascript-promises/" target="_blank">"What's so Great about JavaScript Promises" blog post</a>, will be keynoting at DeveloperWeek this year. Besides his not-to-be-missed talk, we'll also have members of our sales and advocacy teams on hand at the Expo to answer any questions you have about building on Parse.
