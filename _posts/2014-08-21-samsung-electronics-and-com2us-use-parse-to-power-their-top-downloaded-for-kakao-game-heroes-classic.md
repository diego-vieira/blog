[<img class="alignnone wp-image-2459" style="border: 0pt none; float: right; padding-left: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/heroes-classic-300x166.jpg" alt="Heroes Classic" width="330" height="183" />]({{ site.url }}/assets/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/heroes-classic.jpg)With over 100 million registered users on its Kakao Talk platform, Korea's Kakao is quickly becoming one of the most direct and powerful channels possible for reaching potential game players. Kakao Talk is a hugely dominant player in the mobile communications market in Korea, and has begun extending its reach through gaming. Over 90 percent of mobile smartphones in Korea have the Kakao Talk app downloaded, allowing multiple game developers building on the platform to finally break through 10 million downloads.

The latest of these concepts, Heroes Classic for Kakao, is an game powered by Parse. Heroes Classic is the third output from the C-Lab's mobile game development segment, and will be serviced by Com2uS in a collaboration between C-Lab and Com2uS. Com2uS will take care of overall game operations and promotion activities, which are already surging with over 100,000 downloads since its release on the Google Play Store on June 13th.

Heroes Classic is a role-playing game (RPG) where the main goal is to fight off as many monsters as possible within a given time. Its characters, however, are incredibly unique, falling under 8 different categories.

Heroes Classic was intentionally launched on Kakao, as it is the most popular SNS game platform. As the game approaches a global release, more of Facebook Platform's products will be utilized to drive new user traffic. Before selecting Parse, the Heroes Classic team vetted multiple backend-as-a-service companies until Parse's versatile features won them over. As the project leader of Heroes Classic puts it:

> The main benefits of Parse for us was its scalability and Unity integration. Our favorite Parse features are the dialogue control to adjust request limits in addition to the native APIs for each programming language.

Heroes Classic is now available for download on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.com2us.heroesclassic.kakao.freefull.google.global.android.common), and keep an eye out for more hits from Com2uS!
