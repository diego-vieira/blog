Here at Parse, we believe in open source as a way of accelerating innovation, learning from our community, and collaborating on scalable solutions to hard challenges in mobile development.

Over the past year we have been able to make tons of improvements to our developer experience with many contributions from our community — this is in part possible with the open sourcing of [our docs](http://blog.parseplatform.org/announcements/our-docs-are-now-open-sourced/), [our SDKs](http://blog.parseplatform.org/announcements/open-sourcing-our-sdks/), and [beyond](http://blog.parseplatform.org/announcements/open-sourcing-our-facebook-and-twitter-integration-frameworks/). Today we're excited to announce that all of our open source efforts can be now be found in one place – the **[Open Source Hub](http://parseplatform.github.io/)**.

In addition to all of Parse's open source projects, the hub includes [community highlights](http://parseplatform.github.io/#community) to celebrate everything the community has contributed to make Parse even better. As we continue our commitment to open source, we're excited to both help you create the most awesome apps you can, as well as learn new things from the contributions that developers like you make to the platform.
