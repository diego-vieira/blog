Founded in September 2010, [Wantedly](https://www.wantedly.com/) is Japan's largest social recruiting service. In solving the ultimately universal problem of helping people find careers they truly love, Wantedly has employed Parse features to power this process--notably [Parse Push](https://parse.com/products/push) and [Cloud Code](https://parse.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-cloud-code).

Wantedly provides tools and apps that make "work" more exciting for people, and is best known for its social recruiting platform that connects employers to potential employees through the power of the social graph. Originating as a website, Wantedly experienced a huge rush in traffic early on, much of which could be traced back to iOS devices. In the year after its web launch, Wantedly welcomed over 1,000 clients and 40,000 members. From there, the company wanted to make it easier for users to access Wantedly, and began development for a cross-platform suite of applications with the help of Parse.

For Rei Kubonaga, the software engineer responsible for the growth of all of Wantedly's iOS apps, the use of Parse was key from the start of the development process:

> We didn't have to worry about the infrastructure by using Parse, so we were able to focus on the improvement of the service.

Wantedly uses Cloud Code for a streamlined data-saving process. Simultaneously, Wantedly relies on Parse Push to constantly communicate with users. Given the cross-platform nature of Wantedly's many applications, Parse Push has proved to be the most efficient and accessible solution towards driving push notifications on different types of operating systems.

As Wantedly continues to scale its user base, the team has turned to Parse's extensive resource center for even more benefits:

> Â 'Docs' and 'Help' are especially helpful. They are rich in content and clear in description, so we haven't faced any problems. Parse helped us create a stress-free and complication-free development environment.

Today, Wantedly's family of applications include: Contact, Syukatsu Mail Template, Wantedly, Wantedly Admin, and Wantedly Share. The Wantedly app is now available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wantedly.reibun&hl=en). The rest of the family of applications can be found on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/intan-zhuan-zhini-shieru-hui/id804727886?mt=8).
