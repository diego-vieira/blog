The Internet of Things (IoT) is an exciting field for developers, enthusiasts, and academia alike, and no prototyping boards are more popular than the ones that bear Arduino's name. Today we're excited to announce Parse SDK support (starting with release 1.0.3) for the Arduino Zero board with the WiFi 101 shield. [WiFi101](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoWiFiShield101) is a new and powerful Arduino/Genuino shield providing advanced WiFi connectivity, including fast WiFi and the latest security features. This is a powerful and easy-to-use platform based on Atmel's SAMD21 and WINC1500 chipsets.

With the addition of a second platform, we were also able to streamline the Arduino SDK. This single SDK supports both Arduino Zero and Arduino Yun.  We also added the Parse library to Arduino Studio's Library manager. Just install the library and start hacking! So, get your Zero out of the box and <a href="https://www.parse.com/apps/quickstart#embedded/arduinozero" target="_blank">try our quick start guide here</a>.

We are excited to bring the Parse SDK to more platforms than ever, especially to Arduino.  We're looking forward to seeing you develop new bold, challenging, and magical applications with the new Zero. The ball is in your court!
