No, you're not seeing things — **we've got a brand new blog!**

We've given the blog a full, from-scratch overhaul to help you keep up with the latest Parse happenings through a much more pleasant experience. In most ways, our blog has been pretty much the same since <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20121004161320/http://blog.parseplatform.org/" target="_blank">2012</a>. Three years is basically a lifetime on the Internet, so it wasn't hard to convince people internally that it was time for a change.

## So, what's new?

### An Adaptive design

    It's 2014 and <a href="https://twitter.com/ParseIt">@ParseIt</a> a service big on mobile doesn't have a responsive blog site! Come on guys! Seriously! <a href="http://t.co/VkQfw1iyqG">pic.twitter.com/VkQfw1iyqG</a>

We heard your feedback Noah, and we know just as well as you do how important the mobile experience is. This blog is just another step in our march towards a fully adaptive Parse.com. Go ahead, resize that window!

### Search, Categories, & Tags

Use our new blog search to find it! You can also view posts by category to quickly get to what you're looking for. Keep an eye on the side bar for more specific tags that you can use to find similar posts.
