<a href="http://blog.parseplatform.org/learn/secure-your-app-from-the-data-browser-with-pointer-permissions/" target="_blank">Pointer Permissions</a> were launched last June as a powerful new way to secure your app without needing to change your code or database. For many extremely common patterns like messaging and profiles, Pointer Permissions are the easiest way to secure your app. Pointer Permissions are now also available in the latest versions of the open source Parse Server and Parse Dashboard. 

To use this feature, just update your Parse Server version to 2.2.10 and your Parse Dashboard version to 1.0.12. Thanks a bunch for open source contributor <a href="https://github.com/flovilmart" target="_blank">Florent Vilmart</a> for helping with the implementation!
