_The following is a guest post from Sanjeev Dwivedi, Technical Evangelist at Microsoft._

Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 offer a fast growing platform for developers to build apps and start monetizing. Apps you build can be made available to all types of devices, from phones to tablets and Windows 8 PCs, giving you a wide reach of users, from casual to enterprise environment. The opportunity is even larger if you publish your apps to the more than 190 markets where Windows and Windows Phone Stores are available. The Stores also support the largest options of payment instruments, to help more consumers purchase your apps or in-app purchase: we support credit card, debit card, PayPal, mobile operator billing, Alipay (China) and others depending on the market. No other store enables you to publish to all three screens, and is available in so many different markets, with as many payment instruments.

On the technical side, Windows and Windows Phone offer developers a choice on whatever technology they know and are familiar with to develop apps. On both Windows 8 and Windows Phone, you can use C++ or C# to develop your applications, and Windows also offers HTML5/JavaScript - each of these languages have full access to all of the API. So, you can develop apps using technologies that you are familiar with and love.
