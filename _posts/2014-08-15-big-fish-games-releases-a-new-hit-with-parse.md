As the long-standing veteran of the casual games industry, [Big Fish](http://www.bigfishgames.com/) is its largest producer. With a growing catalog of 3,000 plus unique PC games, and 300 plus unique mobile games, Big Fish has distributed more than 2 billion games to date. Its latest game, Cascade, is a new free-to-play title that combines Match-3 functionality with a slot machine for an entirely new, patent-pending game mechanic. Currently, the game features over 140 handcrafted puzzles to be solved by players, with even more to come with regular content updates. Upon its release in July 2014, Cascade was instantly featured as one of the Best New Games of the App Store.

Initially created by developer Funkitron Inc., Big Fish Games is the publisher behind Cascade. With new lands, characters, obstacles, and gems being added each month, Big Fish has turned to Parse to power the game's backend infrastructure. Cascade uses a combination of [Parse Core](https://parse.com/products/core) and Cloud Code to sync game data across players' devices, in addition to utilizing Parse Push to send remote notifications. Given the popularity of playing on both iPhone and iPad, it was crucial for Big Fish to find a solution that allowed for cross-device syncing. According to a producer in the Big Fish internal studio, SkyRocket Studios, Parse has proven to be a key piece to the Cascade puzzle:

> Funkitron engineers found Parse's APIs and SDKs to be stable, full-featured, and easy-to-use, with good documentation and lots of sample code. The ability to customize the service via custom, server-side code was a tremendously useful asset as well. Parse was easy to get started with, and I thought it had a good amount of depth to it in the longer run.

Don't miss Cascade's new spin on Match-3! Available for download on the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cascade/id690852527?mt=8) today.
