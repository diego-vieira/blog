In just over two years, Health & Parenting has hurtled to the top of the charts with its global hits, <a href="http://www.health-and-parenting.com/pregnancy/pregnancy-app/" target="_blank">Pregnancy+</a> and <a href="http://www.health-and-parenting.com/pregnancy/tiny-beats-baby-heartbeat-monitor-app/" target="_blank">Tiny Beats</a>. As a team, Health & Parenting is focused on creating high-quality, innovative apps for new parents. Among its growing suite of products, Pregnancy+ and Tiny Beats are its flagship apps—Pregnancy+ is one of the most popular pregnancy apps in the world with over 2 million downloads per year.  The app and its rich content has been translated into seven languages and is available across countless platforms including the App Store, Google Play Store, Windows Store, Amazon App Store, and more. Tiny Beats, a fetal heart rate monitor app, can be found in fourteen languages and has maintained a consistent spot in the top five rankings of the Medical section of the App Store.

With the use of Parse, the Health & Parenting team has been able to scale their family of apps to reach countless countries and to operate across a wide variety of device platforms.  Parse is used comprehensively--from the sign up process to cloud storage to push notifications and more.  <a href="https://parse.com/products/core" target="_blank">Parse Core</a> is used to securely store app data, enabling users to seamlessly sync their activity across multiple devices, and to restore their information if a device is lost or accidentally wiped.  Using Parse has provided many benefits for the Health & Parenting team and their user base.  As John Miles, CEO, notes:

> Parse has been quick and relatively easy to integrate.  On an ongoing basis, the dashboard gives us clear visibility of our customers' engagement and retention.

The team's favorite aspect of using Parse is the <a href="https://parse.com/products/push" target="_blank">Parse Push</a> product.  Given the intertwined nature of their apps, many customers of the Pregnancy+ app would gain much value from the Tiny Beats App.  Knowing this, the Health & Parenting team utilized Parse Push to announce the launch of Tiny Beats to all existing Pregnancy+ customers.  In just a single weekend, Tiny Beats then soared to number seven overall in the paid UK App Store.  By using Parse Push, Miles found he was able to engage with customers more intimately than ever before:

> Specifically the segmentation of who you're about to push to, and being able to preview how they will see the notification on their device have been our favorites parts of using Parse Push.

Pregnancy+ and Tiny Beats are available for download across platforms.  Find both apps and discover the rest of the Health & Parenting suite of apps <a href="http://www.health-and-parenting.com/" target="_blank">here</a>.
