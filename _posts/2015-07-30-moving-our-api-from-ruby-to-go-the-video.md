It was awesome to see how many of you were interested in our recent [blogpost](http://blog.parseplatform.org/learn/how-we-moved-our-api-from-ruby-to-go-and-saved-our-sanity/) on moving our API stack from Ruby to Go. In fact, it's one of our most visited and commented on posts, ever. We also blogged about some of the [libraries](http://blog.parseplatform.org/learn/parse-loves-go/)Â we used. Earlier this month, Parse engineer Abhishek Kona spoke about how we tackled this at Gophercon. Enjoy this deeper dive into a fun project.
